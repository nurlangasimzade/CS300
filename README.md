CS 300 Module Eight Journal – Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In both projects, I needed to design and implement an advising assistance program for ABCU’s Computer Science department. The main tasks were to load course data from a file, store it in an efficient data structure, and provide menu options to print all courses in alphanumeric order or display information for a specific course.

How did you approach the problem?
In Project One, I analyzed and compared three data structures—vector, hash table, and binary search tree—based on runtime complexity and memory use
. Understanding how each structure handled insertion, search, and sorting was critical. In Project Two, I applied that analysis by implementing the program using my recommended approach. Data structures are essential because the right choice directly impacts performance, scalability, and user experience.

How did you overcome any roadblocks?
One challenge was ensuring clean parsing of the CSV file, especially handling courses with varying numbers of prerequisites. I addressed this by adding whitespace trimming and case normalization
. I also implemented input validation so that invalid menu choices or missing files were handled gracefully.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I now think more deliberately about data structure selection early in the design phase. This project reinforced that you must balance algorithmic complexity, memory considerations, and functional requirements rather than defaulting to familiar structures.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I adopted consistent naming conventions, added inline comments, and separated logic into clear, reusable functions
. The final program is easy to understand, extend, and debug, which will be beneficial if it needs new features or different input formats in the future.
